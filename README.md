# 🏠 House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning
# 🛠️ Project Overview
This project predicts house prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, and amenities. It utilizes Machine Learning (ML) models to analyze historical data and make accurate price predictions.

# 💡 Features
✅ Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, encoding, and normalizing the dataset.
✅ Model Building: Train and evaluate multiple ML models for accurate price prediction.
✅ Visualization: Graphs and charts to analyze feature importance and model performance.
✅ User-Friendly Interface (Optional): A simple web interface to input data and get predictions.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python

# Libraries:

pandas – For data manipulation

numpy – For numerical computations

matplotlib / seaborn – For data visualization

scikit-learn – For ML model training and evaluation

streamlit / Flask (if you have a web interface)

🚀 Installation and Setup
Clone the repository:

bash

🔍 Usage
Input:

Features: size, location, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, etc.

Output:

Predicted house price.

Visualization:

Feature importance, residual plots, and model performance metrics.

# 📊 Results Visualization
The project generates visualizations like:

Scatter plots of actual vs. predicted prices.

Heatmaps showing correlation between features.

Bar charts displaying feature importance.

# 🚀 Future Enhancements
Use Deep Learning models (ANNs) for better accuracy.

Add more location-based features (schools, crime rates, etc.).

Integrate external APIs for real-time data fetching.

Improve visualization with interactive dashboards using Plotly or Dash.
